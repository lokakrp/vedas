Here's a revised version for your GitHub README:
<h1>Ṛgveda and Vedic Information</h1> 
<p>This project features a comprehensive approach to handling Vedic texts, specifically the Ṛgveda. The system uses Python to process raw data obtained from <a href="https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/books/rigveda/">
this metrically restored Ṛgveda resource</a>.</p> 
<h2>Data Processing and Formatting</h2> 
<p>The Python scripts perform the following tasks:</p> 
<ul> <li><strong>Splicing Raw Data:</strong> The raw Ṛgveda data is parsed and spliced based on the indexes of each book. This process ensures that hymns are correctly segmented according to their original structure.</li> 
<li><strong>Formatting Hymns:</strong> Once spliced, the hymns are formatted into a coherent structure, preserving their textual integrity and historical context.</li> 
<li><strong>Conversion to JSON:</strong> The formatted hymns are then converted into JSON files. This step allows for efficient data handling and retrieval on the website.</li> 
</ul> <h2>Website Integration</h2> <p>The JSON files containing the hymns are utilized by the website, which employs JavaScript to dynamically display the Vedic texts. This integration allows users to explore the Ṛgveda in an interactive and accessible format.</p>
