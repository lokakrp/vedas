// intro

at first, i was writing out the text manually and adding the accent using this https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/sanskrit_latin.htm
i then started copying the text line by line into seperate headings from this resource https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/books/rigveda/RV01
i then wanted to automate the process instead of writing out all of the hymns as this would take me FOREVER

// purpose 

this script was made to filter and automate the process of compiling text automatically
i copied the text from the entire page of https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/books/rigveda/RV01, then added each book page into a text file
book_formatter.py then removes the numbers at the beginning, adds A and B together to each line while adding the rest of the lines together
a + b would then have a daṇḍa and then a double daṇḍa would be added to the rest of the lines that were added together
it also reads the index from the number and is able to seperate each hymn and book from each other
after this process, it then converts each book txt into a json file that is able to be added to the webpage
