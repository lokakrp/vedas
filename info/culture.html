            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            The Vedic Aryans were a semi-nomadic, pastoral, and warlike society with a rich religious tradition. Their way of life revolved around cattle 
            herding and agriculture, which were central to their economy and sustenance. This pastoral lifestyle fostered a deep connection with nature,
             reflected in their hymns and rituals dedicated to various deities associated with natural elements. Cows were particularly important, 
             symbolizing wealth and prosperity. The Vedic Aryans were also skilled horsemen and charioteers, using chariots in both warfare and ceremonial 
             contexts. Their warrior ethos often involved engaging in conflicts to protect territory and resources, as well as to assert dominance over 
             rival tribes. Hunting was another essential aspect of their lifestyle, providing food and honing their martial skills. Religion played a 
             pivotal role in their daily lives, with elaborate ceremonies and sacrifices performed to appease the gods and ensure prosperity and victory 
             in battles. Family and kinship were fundamental to their social structure, with extended families living together and upholding strong familial 
             bonds. This family orientation extended to their tribal organization, where tribalism was a key feature, and loyalty to the tribe and its 
             chieftain was paramount.

        <!-- Section: Social structure of Vedic Aryans -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Social Structure</h2>
            The social structure of the Vedic Aryans was organized into a hierarchical system known as the varṇa system, which comprised four primary classes:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Brāhmaṇas</b> - The priestly class responsible for performing religious rituals, preserving sacred knowledge, and providing
                     spiritual guidance. They held significant power and influence due to their role as intermediaries between the gods and the people.</li>
                <li><b>Kṣatriyas</b> - The warrior and ruling class, responsible for protecting the tribe, leading in battle, and governing the
                     people. The Kṣatriyas were often chieftains or kings, and their valor and leadership were highly esteemed in society.</li>
                <li><b>Vaiśyas</b> - The commoners who engaged in agriculture, cattle rearing, trade, and commerce. They played a crucial role in 
                    sustaining the economy and ensuring the community's prosperity through their various occupations.</li>
                <li><b>Śūdras</b> - The laborers and service providers. Many Śūdras were descendants of the Dāsas, a group that was often enslaved 
                    or subjugated by the Aryans. The Dāsas were initially considered outsiders or non-Aryans, and over time, their descendants were integrated 
                    into the Vedic society as Śūdras, performing menial tasks and serving the upper varṇas. Despite their low status, Śūdras were an essential
                     part of the social fabric, contributing to the functioning and maintenance of the community.</li>
            </ul>
            This varṇa system laid the foundation for the later development of the caste system in India, with its rigid social stratification and emphasis on hereditary roles and duties.
