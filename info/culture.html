      <h2>Introduction to Vedic Āryans</h2>
      <p>The Vedic Āryans were a pastoral Indo-Aryan people who settled in the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent around 1500 BCE. They are primarily known from the Ṛgveda, the oldest of the four Vedas, which are ancient Indian sacred texts.</p>
      <p>Their culture was deeply rooted in a pastoral lifestyle, where cattle rearing and agriculture played significant roles in their economy and daily life.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Social Structure</h2>
      <p>Vedic society was organized into varṇas (social classes):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kṣatriyas:</strong> Warriors and rulers who upheld social order and defended the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Brāhmaṇas:</strong> Priests and scholars responsible for religious rituals and the preservation of sacred knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Vaiśyas:</strong> Farmers, traders, and artisans engaged in agriculture and commerce.</li>
        <li><strong>Śūdras:</strong> Laborers and service providers who supported the other varṇas.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section: Pastoral and Agrarian Transition -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Pastoral and Agrarian Transition</h2>
      <p>The early Vedic period marked a transition from nomadic pastoralism to settled village communities. Initially, cattle were the dominant commodity, influencing social and economic structures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gotra:</strong> Signified the endogamous kinship group, centered around cattle.</li>

        <li><strong>Grama:</strong> A community of families forming the basic settlement unit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Clan assemblies (vidāthā, samiti, sabhā) and rituals like yajña (Vedic sacrifice) were pivotal, led by a chief who functioned as a war leader and received tribute (bali) for protecting the clan. Punishment mirrored the wergild principle, with compensation based on social rank.</p>
