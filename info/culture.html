      <h2>Introduction to Vedic Aryans</h2>
      <p>The Vedic Aryans were a pastoral Indo-Aryan people who settled in the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent around 1500 BCE. They are primarily known from the Rigveda, the oldest of the four Vedas, which are ancient Indian sacred texts.</p>
      <p>Their culture was deeply rooted in a pastoral lifestyle, where cattle rearing and agriculture played significant roles in their economy and daily life.</p>

    <!-- Section: Social Structure -->
    <div class="section">

        <li><strong>Kshatriyas:</strong> Warriors and rulers who upheld social order and defended the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Brahmins:</strong> Priests and scholars responsible for religious rituals and the preservation of sacred knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Vaishyas:</strong> Farmers, traders, and artisans engaged in agriculture and commerce.</li>
        <li><strong>Shudras:</strong> Laborers and service providers who supported the other varnas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This hierarchical system defined roles and responsibilities based on birth and occupation, with castes often being inherited from their father.</p>
